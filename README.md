# YetAnotherCoin ðŸ’°

A simple ERC-20-compliant token I made to better understand the [ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).

## Features

- [x] The contract is fully ERC-20-compliant.
- [x] The contract includes additional _mint()_ and _burn()_ functions.
- [x] All interfaces in the ABI are covered by NatSpec annotations.
- [x] Includes tests which provide 100% coverage according to _solidity-coverage_ in _test/yet-another-coin-test.js_.
- [x] Deployment script is located in _scripts/deploy.js_.
- [x] All private deployment data is stored using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
- [x] The contract is deployed to the Rinkeby testnet @0xE5BFd45CAf16D4375Cf819b697eFBc3275707FA1
- [ ] Hardhat tasks were written and stored in _tasks/_, they cover everything in the ABI.
- [ ] Additional _verify_ task is made to easily verify the contract after deployment.
- [ ] All tests, tasks and configs use TypeScript.

**Don't forget to append _--network rinkeby_ when using hardhat commands with the contract deployed to testnet.**
